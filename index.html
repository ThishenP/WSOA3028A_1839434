            <h3>Skateboarding</h3>
            <p>I am currently a professional skateboarder sponsored by Vans and I am ranked 25th on the official South
                african skateboarding rankings. On this site I provide advice to beginner skateboarders as well as
                showcase videos of some of my best tricks. I also provide video tutorials for certain tricks and will
                take requests for tricks you may want to learn.</p>
            <h3>Photography</h3>
            <p>
                In terms of photography I have a portfolio of my best shots on this site. My photography focuses on the
                Johannesburg lifestyle and the skate community within Johannesburg. Many of the photos I post fall into the
                category of urban photography as I am inspired by the architecture and cascading buildings of Johannesburg
                CBD.
