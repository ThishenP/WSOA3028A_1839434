        <h3>Skaterboarding</h3>
        <p>I am currently a professional skateboarder sponsored by Vans and I am ranked 25th on the official South
            african skateboarding rankings. On this site I provide advice to beginner skateboarders as well as
            showcase videos of some of my best tricks. I also provide video tutorials for certain tricks and will
            take requests for tricks you may want to learn.</p>
        <h3>Photography</h3>
        <p>
            In terms of photography I have a portfolio of my best shots on this site. My photography focuses on the
            Johannesburg lifestyle and the skate community within Johannesburg. Many of the photos I post fall into the
            category of urban photography as I am inspired by the architecture and cascading buildings of Johannesburg
            CBD.
