            <p>The garden of forking paths delves into the idea of a labyrinth or maze in which the forking of paths does
                not represent space but time. This thought can be applied in the present age and compared to how we interact
                with the internet. The novel referred to in the garden of forking paths could be considered a hypertext
                novel due to the fact that there is no linear way to read it and it does not make chronological sense. You
                could read through the novel in any order with certain parts linking to others. This directly mirrors the
                way in which the internet works right now. When using the internet it is common for people to continuously
                click through interconnect sites and articles in no particular order.
            </p>
            <p>The fact that sites are all linked to one another leads to a web of interconnected paths that do not have a
                chronological order in which to view but rather a mass of knowledge that users can move through freely. The
                idea of paths forking through time and not space applies to the internet in the sense that people all use
                their time in different ways on the internet based on which path or link they choose to follow and
                investigate.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fact that so many ideas from Jorge Luis Borges are evident in todayâ€™s society illustrates that there are
                many core ideas of how humans would like to communicate and share that did not change over time but came to
                fruition only later due to the lack of technology available. This overarching dream of a garden of forking
                paths may have been realised by the creation of a worldwide network that is now completely normal to us.
