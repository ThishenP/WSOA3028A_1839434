                Its been 26 days since I last skated. 26 DAYS! This is the longest I’ve gone without skating since I
                started. As you all know we have been put under a lockdown due to COVID-19. I unfortunately live in an
                apartment and don’t have a garden to be active in and no pavement to skate on. My daily routine
                currently consists of waking up watching skate videos, eating, watching more skate videos and repeating
                the process over and over until I fall asleep. I’ve also been attempting to take more photos but I can
                only take so many photos of my stationary skateboard in the corner before I lose my mind. I’ve been
                contemplating living in a skate park so technically I would be staying home while I skate. All the days
                are morphing into one and I actually have no idea what day it is today.

                On a more serious note this everyone please be safe and stay home unless you are an essential worker.
                The faster we get through the faster we can get back to reality and finally know what day it is.
