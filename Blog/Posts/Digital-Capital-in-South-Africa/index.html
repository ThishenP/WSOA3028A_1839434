                Digital capital has become a very important area to consider in the present day. An article titled
                "Social capital and the three levels of digital divide"[1] describes the relationship between digital
                capital and the networks of connections in social capital. In South Africa, growth in the use of digital
                media has been massive and real networks and communities have been created using digital capital.
                Certain cases come to mind such as the fact that many companies in South Africa now use LinkedIn to find
                potential employees. This creates a larger network of people that could work together and it may give
                opportunities to the more marginalised groups of our country. However the fact that digital capital is
                characteristically connected to social capital means that all the biases and discrimination of face to
                face networks may still be present. This applies to the South African private sector in which a large
                amount of racial discrimination during hiring process disadvantages people of colour.
            </p>

                The networks created using digital capital can be very helpful in decreasing the closed networks seen in
                the private sector of South Africa but the massive digital divide in our country causes these digital
                capital networks to have opposite effect. The divide allows people with the highest level of digital
                capital work with one another in closed networks and therefore leave others behind.

                Positives can be pulled from the use of digital capital such as the use of social media to bring light
                to pressing issues. This can be seen globally with many currently banding together using social media to
                bring light to racial issues and push forward the Black Lives Matter movement. A South African example
                of this happening is the light that was brought to gender based violence which is so prevalent in our
                society. This led to important conversations about the issues and the organisation of many protests.
                These uses illustrate the positive and unifying power of digital capital in South Africa as well as the
                rest of the world.
