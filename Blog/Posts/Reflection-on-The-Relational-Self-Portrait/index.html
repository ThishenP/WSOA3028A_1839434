                The paper titled <cite>on The Relational Self-Portrait</cite>[1] explores the way in which humans
                portray themselves online and how social media encourages certain behaviours. The paper states that "a
                person can be signified by a static object"[1] and explains this static object representation is what
                paved the way for Social Media as we know it. Social media in many cases is used to create a persona to
                signify one's self and these personas vary between directly representative, representative of one's best
                attributes, or not representative.

                The paper explores the asynchronous nature of social media. I believe that this has a large impact on
                the way we communicate online and could be a reason for misrepresentation of our selves. The
                asynchronous nature means that anything posted can be viewed and interacted with long after it was
                created. This may therefore make the method communication feel more permanent which would lead to users
                feeling the need to put only their best parts forward and hide their flaws. Another reason that I
                believe leads users to portray themselves in a slightly better light is the reward function of social
                platforms. Many platforms reward users for accruing likes and this therefore creates an environment of
                trying to better one another. This leads users to portray themselves in a way that maximises likes.

                Although the paper speaks much about the way in which social media causes humans to interact with one
                another, it does not delve into the outcomes of these methods of interaction. These outcomes include new
                types relationships being formed. A paper Titled <cite>Social Media and Relationships</cite>[2] dives
                into the ways
                in which social media can create new types of relationships as well as effect existing relationships.
                The text explains that social media has 3 types of impact on relationships. It either enables new
                relationships, Substitutes offline relationships or reinforces offline relationships. Social media does
                however have many bubbles and homogeneous communities this could therefore reduce the diversity and
                quality of relationships. That being said I do believe that social media does have a strong power to
                introduce people and can therefore create new and meaningful relationships. Social Media's ability to
                bring you into contact at all times with offline friends is also very powerful and can strengthen
                offline relationships.
