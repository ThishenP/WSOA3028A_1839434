                A metaphor in the UI and UX field refers to a widely recognizable and commonly used representations of
                more complex concepts. In The paper titled <cite>Metaphor Design for User Interface</cite> [1], Author
                Aaron Marcus
                dives into the intricate details of what makes Metaphor based UI design so powerful and important in the
                overall context of user-experience. The text describes the way in which users understand and relate to
                these metaphors. The paper provides a good overview and shows many uses and applications of these
                metaphors in UI design. However, does not expand much on specific uses.

                One particular use and benefit of UI metaphors that I would like to expand on is the creation of
                familiar
                environments for the user. One of the most valuable uses of a metaphor to create an environment would be
                the desktop. The desktop metaphor has proven extremely useful throughout the years of human-computer
                interaction. Before this useful representation of data, many users had to deal with direct interaction
                with a terminal. This method still has many benefits, but for many users this may be disorientating and
                foreign. A large portion of users would have had previous experience with viewing and interacting with
                information on a physical desk. Years of humans’ interaction with a physical desktop environment has
                developed our brains in such a way that we are comfortable with organising data in our minds and
                understanding the data in the context of a desk top. Instead of making users adapt to a computer’s
                methods of data representation, developers should focus on pulling from human psychology and commonly
                accepted norms in order to allow for a more satisfactory user experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                A paper titled <cite>Interface and Design Metaphors</cite> [2] analyses more technically, the uses and
                metaphors and
                how to achieve a high level of accessibility for users. The text describes and gives more detail on
                ideas from the previously mentioned paper. A crucial part of the text goes into the fact that the
                “reduction of interpretation complexity is considered as a condition of, ‘good’ metaphor”. The thought
                that reduction of complication and a move towards more minimal design with a heavier reliance on
                metaphors is considered a good thing. Although it is beneficial in cases there are some downsides. Since
                everything relies on these representations, a user may have a lack of experience with certain metaphors
                and this would be incredibly detrimental to their ability to use the software. This design may go on to
                alienate some users as well as cultures that do not have the same common experience and norms. This
                divide is illustrated by the speed in which younger users understand mobile app interfaces compared to
                older users who have not had as much experience with these systems. UI designers should focus on
                creating easy to use systems by implementing metaphors but must keep in mind the differences in cultures
                and if others relate to those metaphors.
