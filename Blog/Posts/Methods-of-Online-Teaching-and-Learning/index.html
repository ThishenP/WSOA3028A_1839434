        <section class="e-content">
            <p>In light of the recent outbreak of COVID-19 it is important to limit the number of public gatherings
                taking place. This is relevant in the sense of learning as it calls for self-isolation and therefore a
                lack of face to face learning. This brings up an important area in which South Africa and many other
                countries have not focused on. Without in person teaching capabilities schools and universities would
                have to turn to online and remote learning. In developing countries such as South Africa there are many
                restricting factors such as a lack of access to reliable internet sources as well as a lack of access to
                sufficient technology. Since there such a divide of wealth in South Africa using traditional online
                learning solutions may lead to disadvantaging those who were previously disadvantaged. I will go on to
                outline possible ways to provide a suitable online learning experience that equally benefits all
                students.
            </p>
            <p>
                in the paper <cite>Evaluation of elearning usage in South African universities: A critical review</cite>
                the authors state that “Since 1994, education reformation
                has been a priority to promote equality among all races” [1]. This indicates the importance that has
                been placed on education and how it could empower a disadvantaged section of society in hopes of
                levelling the playing field. Since education is so powerful using it in the wrong way could be
                incredibly damaging. This is why there should be a large amount of consideration into the way in which
                we use E-learning to ensure access is not limited by class or wealth differences.
            </p>
            <h2>Low data usage E-learning</h2>
            <p>
                The exorbitant data prices in South Africa are a major limiting factor to E-learning so finding ways to
                transfer learning material using a low amount of data is important. I have listed some possible
                solutions below.
            </p>
            <h3>Audio and Text Combinations</h3>
            <p>
                Videos are the suitable way to communicate and teach a difficult topic to students but it can use a
                large amount of bandwidth. In order to get a similar sort of experience that could help with complex
                subjects, a combination of audio files and written documents could work. Students could listen to
                explanations done through audio and simultaneously look through the notes for visual feedback. Audio
                fidelity is measured in Bit Rates with the typical MP3 song being either 128 kbps or 320 kbps. For a
                speech only recording, a much lower bit rate can be used. An article by Richard Farrar [2] states that a
                48-kbps bit rate would be suitable for longer speech podcasts. Using this lower bit rate is very
                beneficial and will lower bandwidth usage substantially.
            </p>
            <h3>File Compression</h3>
            <p>
                A large amount of compression could be used on learning materials before distributing to learners to
                lower bandwidth usage. An article about compression formats [3] states that RAR compression is superior
                to ZIP compression and “7Z compression is slower and more powerful compressor than RAR”. The article
                also states that a higher compression ratio comes from slower more intensive algorithms. This means
                using 7Z compression would lead to a smaller file for students to download while still containing the
                same data. I would recommend using 7Z compression for documents alongside a low bitrate audio file.
            </p>
            <h3>Low-bandwidth File System</h3>
            <p>
                This type of file system dynamically checks the similarities between files or versions of the same file
                on a system and avoids transferring similar data between server and client. This therefore leads to a
                large amount of bandwidth saved in both interactive and direct file sharing capacities. A report on
                Low-Bandwidth Network File Systems by Computer scientists from MIT and NYU states that the system
                “consumes over an order of magnitude less bandwidth than traditional networking file systems” [4]. These
                types of systems can be very effective in the South African networking climate and therefore should be
                considered when looking at E-learning in South Africa.
            </p>
            <h2>Solutions for Accessibility Problems</h2>
            <p>
                The ideal situation would be if every student had free access to the internet at a suitable speed. There
                are steps that have been taken in the past in which students were given free access to university
                websites by certain service providers. One example of this situation is the fact that Vodacom has given
                all university students on their platform access to certain university websites and other ICT related
                resources. In order for South Africa to truly empower disadvantaged learners through education, policy
                must be put in place to give all users the same amount of access through ensuring all service providers
                allow university or school resources to be accessed for free.
