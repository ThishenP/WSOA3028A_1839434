                Metadata is a very important aspect of what makes the internet accessible to all users. Metadata refers to
                data which holds information about data. This data explains to bots and or browsers what type of data it is
                looking at and how to deal with such data. Metadata is used behind the scenes in order to display a
                user-friendly and accessible experience for all users.
            </p>
            
            <p>Metadata can be extremely useful in categorisation and organisation of websites. This is extremely beneficial
                for search engines and everyone using them as the hidden metadata of websites may include things like tags
                or author names. This therefore gives the search engine the ability to use this information to direct users
                to the site they were looking for based on a search that may not exactly mirror the website but still
                relates to the metadata of the site. A user could search for an author and the engine will be able to look
                through the metadata of sites and direct users to the site they were looking for.
            </p>
            <p>Metadata is usually stored and managed in a database known as a metadata registry or repository but extra
                information is needed to understand these databases. This information is hidden from users but utilised by
                computers and programmers in order to only display content relevant to the user.
