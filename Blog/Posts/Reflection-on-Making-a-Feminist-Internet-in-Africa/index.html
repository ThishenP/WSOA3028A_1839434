                The article[1] makes many important observations of the impact the internet has and the ways in which it
                applies to African Feminists. The article talks about the importance of having LGBTIQA representation in
                online spaces. The current climate of the Internet lacks the sort of representation that leads to
                acceptance of differing views and non conformity. Better representation could change the landscape of
                the internet and people's stereotypical perceptions. The internet is believed by many to be the place of
                straight white males but in reality it should be a diverse and multicultural landscape for future
                possibilities. I do believe the internet can be a powerful tool to combat the hate found in society but
                something would have to change. Sheena Magenya brings up the need to combat the unequal section of
                internet users creating a narrative for the whole of the internet. In order to do this it is important
                that African feminists are encouraged to interact and contribute in to discussions about the internet
                and therefore push a more inclusive narrative.

                It is important for everyone to stand up for an inclusive internet but the internet can be a hateful
                place and can put people off. The internet allows people to hide behind their online persona and
                therefore say the most harmful things they could imagine. This creates a toxic environment for those
                trying to bring about a more diverse and compassionate environment. Another factor that adds to the
                toxicity of internet interactions is the fact that internet app algorithms feed users exactly what they
                are looking for and therefore do not give people counter points or differing opinions. This leads to
                'echo chamber' type communities being formed in which hateful rhetoric is spread which further leads
                users to extremes. The best way to combat this in my opinion is to have a variety of perspectives being
                shown to everyone. This could be achieved if more people had the mindset that Sheena Magenya has.
