                Note: The character Avery Sosa was not created with specific race. For the purposes of this post i will
                assume he is Indian (like me) in order to keep a level of authenticity and therefore not attempt to
                speak for another race who have had vastly different life experiences.

                I am deeply saddened and angered by the brutal murders of George Floyd and Collins Khosa as well as the
                countless black men killed for the colour of their skin. Growing up as a person of colour in a country
                plagued with racial inequalities I have definitely felt racism and felt out of place around many of my
                peers. I do however recognise my privilege as an Indian man in the fact that I am not continuously
                fearing for my life when doing nothing wrong. Black people in America and South Africa as well as many
                other countries face these fears day after day without rest. The fact that we even have to say that
                Black Lives Matter illustrates the enormous lack of concern that many have for human lives based solely
                on their preconceived notions of race.

                The rage and sadness many of us feel is completely warranted because we are witnessing heinous acts
                being committed by law enforcement who are supposed to protect and serve and be a beacon of safety. This
                rage and sadness will continue to linger in my mind but I am encouraged by the amount of support the BLM
                movement is getting and the world wide public outcry for justice. Many previous moments of public outcry
                have been temporary. I therefore want to encourage all people to bring the positive anti-racism
                sentiments they see and spread on social media into the physical world for the rest of their life. This
                will therefore not let the outrage be a short trend but rather have a long lasting impact.

                To all that say all lives matter, If one house on a street is burning, firemen would not pour water on
                every house on the street but only the one in danger. I believe that we can one day get to a point in
                which black people feel safe to roam the streets without fear but in order to do this we have to work
                together and continue to educate ourselves. We must make ourselves heard in order to ensure decisive
                action is taken by governments in terms of policy and that the murderers of George Floyd, Collins Khosa
                and many others are held accountable.
