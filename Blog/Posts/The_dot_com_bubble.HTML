                The dot com bubble was an extremely important moment in the history of the internet and the way in which
                internet companies were run. The dot com bubble refers to a period of time in which a massive amount of
                growth
                was seen in many internet based companies. This growth led to many people seeing any internet company as a
                foolproof investment in which nothing could go wrong. People continued to invest large amounts of money in
                any
                company that fit the mould but there was a lack of research done into these companies. Full business models
                were
                not discussed or developed fully but people invested because of fast growth. The fast growth was mainly due
                to
                many buying into the idea of internet business but was not backed by any real financial forecasts or
                valuations.
            </p>
            <p>In the year 2000 a catastrophe began taking place in which many large internet companies were lost due to the
                fact that most funding came from hype and misinformation. Once the first few companies started to show bad
                signs
                it led to investors getting scared and moving out of the industry in a frenzied fashion. This point in time
                changed the face of internet companies forever as now they are needed to be more professional and be run
                more
                like traditional businesses. This was ultimately a much needed lesson and was important in moving towards a
                more
                steady and beneficial economy overall but as we have seen by the crypto currency bubble, history repeats
                itself.
                These events show us how important financial information of companies is as well as how important education
                and
                regulation of unicorn tech companies is.
