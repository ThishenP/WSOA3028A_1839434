                The power of technology is growing rapidly as well as the need to use the internet to interact
                effectively with many parts of society. With this growth there is the possibility for some groups to be
                left behind and therefore be disconnected with this globally connected network. Accessibility refers to
                whether technology can be used by people with disabilities. This therefore means a focus has to be put
                onto accessibility to ensure nobody is left behind.
            </p>
            <p>
                An article on Disability and health from the World Health Organisation states that "Over a billion
                people, about 15% of the world's population, have some form of disability"[1]. This statistic
                illustrates scale of our disabled population on Earth and highlights the importance of building
                accessible systems. The amount of disabilities that may prevent users from interacting with certain
                technology can be massive and is not something that can be ignored. "There is also the fact that the
                internet offers one of the easiest ways to communicate and do business with people who suffer from a
                disability"[2] This excerpt from An article titled <cite>Making the Web Accessible to All</cite> shows
                the way in
                which the internet can connect those with disabilities and therefore both benefit the economy and the
                individuals. It benefits the economy as it allows for the communication with a large and sometimes
                forgotten section of the market.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some methods to achieve a good level of accessibility include added appropriate semantic markup and
                micro formats to allow bots to read out content to blind users as well as taking into account colour
                blind users when choosing a colour pallet. Developers should also add captions or subtitles to videos to
                aid deaf users.
