                A digital divide refers to an unequal distribution of access to ICT systems. This causes major issues in
                terms of the quest for equal opportunity for all. This problem is very evident in the context of South
                Africa and has recently been emphasised by sudden switch to online learning methods due to unforeseen
                circumstances. The digital divide in South Africa comes from a large wealth disparity. This disparity
                was formed because of apartheid and therefore disproportionately effects people of colour. The disparity
                alongside the lack of infrastructure provided in poorer areas is cause for such digital divide.

                "It doesnâ€™t take much to see that internet access, education, skilled-employment and technological
                innovation are stratified along class and racial lines, thus reinforcing apartheid-era inequality."[1]
                This is an extract from an article titled <cite>Bridging The New Digital Divide</cite>[1]. This quote
                illustrates
                the fact that the benefits of digital access are extremely powerful and those who don't have access may
                be left behind which further builds up the inequalities from the apartheid era. The article also
                highlights the fact that digital methods are beginning to do tedious low skill jobs efficiently. This
                heavily affects a large group of people who have historically had much less opportunity for education
                due to factors outside of their control (i.e. apartheid). These groups could therefore lose the jobs
                that may be essential for their livelihood. The fact that the historically marginalised classes and
                races do not have as much access to ICT services, means that they will not reap the benefits of the new
                opportunities created by digital systems due to the fact that these opportunities require an
                understanding and familiarity with digital environments.

                The capabilities of ICT systems are revolutionary and to not have access provides an extreme
                disadvantage. Therefore in order to grow as an equal and unified nation we have to focus on closing this
                gap. I feel as if in the current context of the world digital capabilities and internet access are
                essential in a similar way to electricity. I believe that internet should be a government provided
                service. This would therefore allow for a more evenly distributed spread of digital capabilities between
                all classes and races.
