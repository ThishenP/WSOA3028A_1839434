                I have received many questions about how to learn to skate. I believe there are many different paths you
                could take to learn to skate and the way I learnt is not the only way. I do believe that there are main
                principles of learning that can be applied to any field. I’ll use this post to talk about the way I look
                at learning and relate it to my personal journey.

                First of all, I don’t think the ‘how’ is the most important part. It does hold some importance but does
                not outweigh persistence and consistency. The hard part is not finding a way to learn especially now in
                the internet age with many tutorials freely available. The hard part is the consistent practising and
                persisting through your own self-doubts. This means the focus should be on doing something you enjoy and
                therefore being more motivated to push through the difficult moments. It is important to always take
                into account how far you have come during your pursuit of a skill and therefore enjoy each moment as it
                comes. It is good to look to the future and work towards something but be sure that you don’t get
                trapped in that hope and feel as if the final product will bring satisfaction. Enjoy the problem not the
                solution.

                I believe to build a skill like skating, which needs a large amount of muscle memory, you need to
                practice frequently. When I was beginning, I practised every once in a while, for a large amount of
                time. I realised that I was not progressing very much. I then switched to practising for a short amount
                of time every day and the progress was substantially higher than I expected. I believe that practising
                15 minutes every day is better that practising for 5 hours on once a week. Although the first option
                amounts to a lot less overall practice time I believe the repetition is what will lead to real progress.

                Keep in mind this is only my experience and everyone learns differently. Don’t let anyone tell you that
                you are doing it wrong. I say this because the main thing I’ve learnt in life is no one really has the
                answers and that’s what makes it fun.
