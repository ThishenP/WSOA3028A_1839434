            <p>web 2.0 - The introduction of web 2.0 led to substantial changes in the way we interacted with the internet
                and each other. Web 2.0 is defined as an internet in which users could interact with websites and share
                their own experiences and ideas. Before this evolution of the web the internet was considered a one way from
                of communication in which many people around the world had access to a collection of information created by
                a smaller group of people. With the introduction of web 2.0 collaboration between a much larger amount of
                people became possible. This therefore allowed anybody to add the large wealth of knowledge collected and
                accessible through the internet.
            </p>
            <p>A very important example of the benifits of web 2.0 would be Wikipedia and the extremely fast and
                comprehensive collecting of the worlds knowledge. This was such a powerful tool due to the fact that all
                users of the internet were able to interact with the site and therefore all contribute to a singular goal.
                This large amount of co-operation often refered to as crowd sourcing played a massive role in shaping the
                internet and wealth of knowledge at our finger tips that many of us take for granted
            </p>
            <p>
                This collaboration led to massive networks of like minded people across the world in which information and
                entertainment could spread at an extremely rapid rate. Meme culture thrived through this phenomena of easy
                shareabilty. The ability for anyone to add and interact with the internet also leads to a decreased level of
                credibility to what could be read on the internet and this leads a large amount of fake news being spread.
