                Hypertext in the current context of the world plays an enormous role in how the human race develops and
                gains knowledge. This way of consuming media and information has become natural to us and shapes the way
                we think.

                Hypertext focuses on cross referencing between related sections of text as well as visual material. In a
                paper titled <cite>Real and Virtual Spaces: Mapping from Spatial Cognition to Hypertext</cite>[1],
                author Simon
                Shum highlights the relationship between the navigation of the real world and the navigation of
                information. Like navigation in the real-world hypertext allows the users freedom to travel down any
                route they please. Users have the ability to get lost down a rabbit hole of information linked to other
                information much like the ability people have to get lost in navigating our traditional roads.

                The use of a non-linear representation of information can be beneficial in the sense that it allows
                users to make their own path and can therefore find what interests them in a more efficient way. There
                is however an argument that this method of navigating a large amount of data can take away from the
                enjoyment and engagement the user might feel with the information. Many of us could be considered easily
                distracted and this form of navigation could be very detrimental to those who have trouble focusing.
                Hypertext navigation encourages users to continuously move onto new sections of information and this
                could lead to people taking in only small parts of each section of information or media. With a linear
                text or piece of information users are forced to engage with the text and directly focus on all parts of
                the text without being dragged to another subject. I believe hypertext is very efficient in the storing
                and structuring of data and it allows for an efficient way of gaining knowledge. It does however have
                downsides that must be considered and users must make the decision on how to consume media of a certain
                type or learn based on what experience they are looking for at that moment.
