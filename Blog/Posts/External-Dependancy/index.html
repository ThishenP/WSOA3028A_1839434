                The google maps JavaScript API is being used as an external dependency for the site. The API is being
                leveraged to display a map of Johannesburg with all of the content photos overlayed at the position they
                were taken. The map can be found in the media section where users can switch between map view and
                gallery view. Avery Sosa’s movement around Johannesburg is a very important part of his character and
                the map therefore gives him a way to share the places that he has discovered around his city. It is
                therefore necessary to have this dependency as it accurately gives users insight into Avery’s world and
                combines it with the wealth of information about these places that is stored on google. This also helps
                to bring light to the lesser known parts of the city.
            </p>

                Other options for this dependency could have been used such as MapBox or Bing Maps but the free google
                maps API offered much more. Of all the options Google Maps has the biggest library by far and this would
                therefore allow for better recognition and accuracy of the lesser known areas that Avery may frequent.
                Maps also gives visitors access to the street view of each photo's position. In a development sense
                Google Maps had clear documentation on how to leverage the API.

                On a more technical note each photo on the HTML page includes data attributes for latitude and
                longitude. This is used in a general JavaScript function to create an element on the map for each image
                on the page in its corresponding position. Ideally the function would use the exif.js framework to pull
                the EXIF data from an image. EXIF data contains geotags which could have been used to place the photo
                instead of pulling positions from data attributes in HTML. This functionality could not be implemented
                at this stage as only one external dependency was allowed for the project. It could however, easily be
                used for any other projects using similar functionality. Geotag data was not available for the photos so
                I chose photo positions around Johannesburg CBD that represent where the character would go. The
                JavaScript Google Maps API has functionality that will call a specific callback function after
                completion. The function that it calls is named initMap(). Once the page content is loaded the map is
                created and the system searches the page to find all images on the page. The location data is extracted
                from these images and each image is added to the map. During implementation it was found that a user
                with slower internet could switch to the map section before the photos had loaded. This led to the code
                not picking up on all photos and displaying only a few photos. This was rectified by entering
                functionality that only allowed for users to switch to the map after it had been populated. Google
                provided an API key which would be used to allow for access to the map. Since all code is being pushed
                to GitHub the key is public for anyone to see and to secure against unauthorised use I restricted the
                key to only run on my GitHub Pages domain.
