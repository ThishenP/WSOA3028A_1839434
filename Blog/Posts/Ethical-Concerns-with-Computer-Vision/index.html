                Computer vision is a field in which machine learning methods are combined with sensor systems,
                particularly cameras, to classify objects without human input. Technology coming from research in this
                field is incredibly powerful and can have positive or negative impacts. This can be seen in the tweet,
                by Joe Redmon[1], that is quoted above in which he announced that he would no longer work in the field
                due to ethical concerns. This sentiment is not exclusive to the field or the current era. Many in
                research fields grapple with whether to keep developing their particular field when the enhancements can
                be used very effectively for good but at the same time would be just as effective when used maliciously.
                This post will discuss the ethical issues of computer vision as well as compare the field to other
                scientific and technological advancements with serious ethical concerns.

                There are a myriad of ethical issues regarding computer vision with surveillance being a prime example.
                If this surveillance technology combined with facial recognition technology fell into the wrong hands it
                could very detrimental to a society. Privacy and the right to relative anonymity is at risk when these
                systems are in place. Facial recognition methods are incredibly powerful and dangerous due to the fact
                that it can identify from a distance. “The system can track subjects and capture facial images at
                distances of 25–50 m and can recognise them using a commercial face recognition system at a distance of
                15–20 m”[2]. This quote came from a paper written by engineers who were investigating to what extent
                they could realistically use facial recognition. The fact that this technology is so effective from
                distance means that it easily identify people without their consent. An authoritative government could
                use this to identify individuals protesting and with that information silence them in other malicious
                ways. An article from the guardian[3] states that all Chinese citizens registering new SIM cards must
                submit facial recognition scans. This therefore gives the Chinese government and organisations
                comprehensive facial data and a powerful way to identify them without consent. China has been accused of
                using these systems immorally for control over citizens.

                The better these systems get the more they can impact the world in both a negative and positive way so
                how do researchers and scientists deal with this moral dilemma. I believe that humans are inherently
                curious and this is a key characteristic driving the development of our species. However the more we
                enhance our tools the more opportunity there is to create large amounts of damage. An example in which
                scientific research and discovery with good intent led to terrible atrocities would be the research into
                nuclear reactions. Scientists hoped for this research to go into the creation of a very powerful and
                sustainable source of energy. This pure endeavour to create something beneficial and fulfil human
                curiosity ended up giving the human race the power to cause extinction. Another common example of these
                problems can be the research into stem cells which can seriously benefit society and have a positive
                world changing impact. This on the other hand could allow for the bio engineering of diseases in the
                future if used by the wrong people.

                These problems pose the question: should we keep developing such powerful and potentially dangerous
                systems? We may be better off without these developments in a sense but that is not possible with the
                built in curiosity of humankind. Since this outcome is not possible I feel as if people such as Joe
                Redmon should continue to research the field because of the fact that he is aware and passionate about
                the ethical considerations of the field. Within the field, those concerned with ethics can look into
                preventative measures that need to take place. People like Joe could steer the field into a moral and
                ethical direction and therefore put in place mechanisms to restrict unethical use. I would much rather
                have ethically concerned people be part of the development than stop all together and leave all
                decisions to those with immoral intentions. This is all made especially important due to the rapid
                growth in machine learning systems we are currently seeing.
