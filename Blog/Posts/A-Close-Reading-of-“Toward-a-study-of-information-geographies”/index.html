            <p>
                The internet has long been a defining factor in the collection and distribution of knowledge and
                information on an almost unfathomable scale. This network of interconnected users can have an impact
                everywhere in the world but is not shared in an equal way with key difference severely limiting the
                geographical and cultural reach of the ideal all-inclusive dream for the system. The authors of the
                paper <cite>Toward a study of information geographies</cite>[1] delve into the reasons behind this. The paper
                states that all information has inherent geographical links. "it is mediated by networks,
                infrastructures, and technologies: all of which exist in physical, material places"[1]. This quote from
                the text outlines those links. This text also informs us that information in all forms is tied to the
                linked geography. The text goes on to describe the inequalities faced with the geographical
                representation of data using a wide range of internet usage and representation data. This blog post will
                analyse the results found as well as compare the findings to other sources
            </p>
            <p>
                The study describes mutable mobiles as "information that can be transported without significant change
                to its inherent characteristics or meaning"[1]. The authors then extend this definition into the ICT
                area using the term (Im)mutable augmentations. This is described as a dynamic layering of information.
                This layering of information could in a sense become part of the place or geography itself. This
                illustrated that restrictions of infrastructure and other factors can have an incredibly large impact on
                specific physical regions and therefore potential problems need to be carefully considered.
            </p>
            <h3>Access and Enablement</h3>
            <p>The paper dives into the geography of access to the internet and the per capita usage of the internet in
                each country. The data is represented in such a away that countries with more internet users are larger
                than those with less. In the representation China is the largest country but a good amount of that scale
                could be due to their incredibly large population. India on the other hand has a similar population but
                is represented much smaller in comparison due to a lower level of internet access. It can be seen that
                the data is skewed by the larger population but not to an extent that makes data invalid. The distortion
                of country sizes to fit the data illustrates how far behind much of Africa is. The internet population
                is incredibly low in some African countries and looking at even lower level limiting factors it is
                stated in the paper titled <cite>Internet Going Mobile: Internet access and usage in eleven African
                    countries</cite>[2] that 'Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and Ethiopia have not reached 20% of households connected
                to the electricity grid'[2]. This paper was published in 2013 so there may have been further
                advancements but it still illustrates the level of inaccessibility in certain African countries. The
                study shows the cost of broadband relative to average income in each country and it is evident that many
                African countries struggle with the problem of overpriced broadband. South Africa fits into the lower
                end of broadband cost in Africa but is high compared to the rest of the world. This is illustrated an
                article titled <cite>African broadband prices versus the world</cite>[3].
            </p>
            <h3>Participation</h3>
            <p>Participation in terms of creating and editing data on the internet was measured in the study by looking
                at contributions to Wikipedia, contributions to GitHub, and listing of domain names in each country. The
                data represented in this section of the paper shows the to a larger extent the lack differences in
                contribution and informational geography between the north and the south. Africa specifically is shown
                to have a very low impact in terms of participation with only South Africa having a relatively
                substantial level of participation. This could be due to the way in which countries with a lower level
                of technological impact interact with the internet. The paper, <cite>going mobile: Internet access
                    and use in 11 African countries</cite>[2], states that a large amount of internet usage in Africa is
                facilitated through mobile devices. Mobile devices may encourage and discourage certain interactivity
                with the web. For example GitHub is very rarely used through mobile devices and interacting with
                services to create web domains is not encouraged through the mobile medium.
            </p>
            <h3>Representation</h3>
            <p>
                Data collection in terms of representation was done using google search results and mapping data stored
                on each area as well as Geo Tagging data.  The google search results may be slightly skewed for certain
                countries. The text states that "the country that has the most database entries per internet user is
                Chad"[1]. Chad is a commonly used name and is also commonly used in internet culture meaning the data
                may have been skewed as it takes all appearances of the search term into account. These results further
                illustrate the divide between North and South based on data saved about each area. America comes out on
                top of most of the metrics for representation on the web.
            </p>
            <h3>Impact of informational geographic inequality</h3>
            <p>
                It has been proven that there are large disparities between the information that is accessible in
                certain areas and the representation of these areas in global information. This can have serious effects
                on the development of economies as well as the representation of cultures around the world. The power
                that the internet and access to information can be seen all around us. It allows for citizens of a
                country to learn almost any skill, collaborate easily with one another and have access to state of the
                art software to help in any field. All these factors would benefit the country in terms of development
                and lead to a higher GDP. Countries that do not have access to the internet will in turn not have access
                to the previously mentioned benefits and therefore use outdated, slower methods of production and
                development. This therefore leads to an ever increasing gap between those with strong access and those
                without. In terms of the cultural impact the differences in representation of certain areas poses a
                large problem. Authentic knowledge of other cultures and events around is incredibly important and when
                a focus is put on certain cultures, others become neglected. An increase in authentic knowledge about a
                large variety of people can make people more accepting of one another and therefore decrease cultural
                insensitivity around the world. This however is not the case with such disparities in representation.
