                Its happening. we are saved. A gift from the gods is on the way. For those of you living under a rock,
                the game, Skate 4 is in development and scheduled for release in 2022. Skate 3 was a hug part of my
                childhood and everyday after skating we would all go back to my friend's house and play for hours upon
                hours. Many of my best tricks in real life were inspired and influenced by the Skate games. Since I
                can't skate much in our current situation I've picked up skate again and it's just as good as 10 years
                ago. My excitement for the game is growing at an alarming rate and there is no sign of stopping so I
                hope 2022 comes fast. This news made my day and I hope it is the beginning of a redemption arch for
                2020.
