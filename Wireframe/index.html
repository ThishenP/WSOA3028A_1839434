            <h2>Form Factors</h2>
            <p>This website caters for three distinct form factors with specific breaks between common desktop, tablet
                and mobile viewport dimensions.
                This was designed using desktop first methods.
                Much of the website constantly scales with size due to the use of relative sizing units such as
                percentages and viewport height and width.</p>
            <h3>Desktop</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="../Source/Images/UI screenshots/Desktop.png" alt="site navbar as seen on desktop"
                    style="width:100%">
                <figcaption>Figure 1 - Desktop Navbar</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="../Source/Images/UI screenshots/DesktopGrid.png" alt="gallery as seen on dekstop"
                    height="250">
                <figcaption>Figure 2 - Desktop Grid View</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The full sized desktop navbar can be seen in figure 1. This navbar makes use of a large amount of space
                with
                relatively small text due to the fact that this view will most likely appear on larger screens. Figure 2
                shows the way in which grids are displayed when using a desktop form factor.
                The grid uses rows of three in this form due to benefits of a large viewing environment.
                This applies to all grid
                sections on the website including media and blog posts.
                Photos in this form display a caption containing the photographer for each photo when a user hovers over
                the photo.
                This is made possible due to the fact that devices usign this form factor have mouse capabilities and
                can therefore hover over the photos</p>
            <h3>Tablet</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="../Source/Images/UI screenshots/Tablet.png" alt="site navbar as seen on a tablet"
                    style="width:100%">
                <figcaption>Figure 3 - Tablet Navbar</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="../Source/Images/UI screenshots/TabletGrid.png" alt="gallery as seen on a tablet"
                    height="250">
                <figcaption>Figure 4 - Tablet Grid</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Figure 3 shows the navigation bar that is displayed when a user is using the tablet form factor. In this
                case the links have increased in size due to the smaller screens and the likely use of touch screen. The
                logo / name has been moved to the center with links below to fit the elements into a smaller space.
                Figure 4 shows the way in which grids are displayed on the tablet form factor. The grid is switched to
                rows of two which increases image size to ensure user can view the images on their smaller screen. This
                form displays captions of photographer credits by default as it is assumed that the user would be using
                a touch screen and can therefore not hover over images.
            </p>
            <h3>Mobile</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="../Source/Images/UI screenshots/Mobile.png" alt="site navbar as seen on a mobile phone"
                    height="100">
                <figcaption>Figure 5 - Mobile Navbar closed</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="../Source/Images/UI screenshots/mobileDown.png" alt="site navbar as seen on a mobile phone"
                    height="250">
                <figcaption>Figure 6 - Mobile Navbar open</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="../Source/Images/UI screenshots/MobileGrid.png" alt="gallery as seen on a mobile phone"
                    height="250">
                <figcaption>Figure 7 - Mobile Grid</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Figure 5 shows the navigation bar as seen from a mobile devices form factor (smartphone). All links are
                hidden by default in order to avoid clutter on the small screen while still giving the user access to
                all functionality. This functionality is given by the drop down icon which can be pressed to display all
                links as shown in figure 6. The way in which grid items are shown in this form can be seen in figure 7.
                In this case one item is showed per row allowing users to easily scroll through and view the elements
                clearly.

            <p>The navigation bar displayed here will be used for all pages. Due to the importance of a call to action
                for users, buttons will be added to direct users to different sections of the website. A selected accent
                colour will be used to draw user’s attention to the buttons. A larger banner photo of the character will
                be used and attempt to draw user attention. This will also serve as an element that uses the whole of
                the screen space as oppose to the content areas.</p>

            <p>Previously all blogs were on the same page but to fall within the UI characteristics of minimalism and
                readability each blog was moved onto its own page. These blogs will be represented on the blog page as
                cards containing the blog title and detail relating to the blog. It will also include an image that
                relates to the blog.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="style-choices">
            <h2>Website Style Choices</h2>
            <p>
                The design philosophy focused on when planning the website were minimalism and ease of use. Many of the
                choices were made in order to increase ease of use by attempting to increase readability, decrease
                clutter and using commonly known design metaphors
            </p>
            <p>
                Readability will be achieved by picking colours of text that does not contrast harshly with the
                background. The background will be a dark grey colour to reduce strain on the user’s eyes with text
                being a much lighter grey close to white. Another factor to increase readability of long pieces of text
                is the use of a container in which the maximum width of content areas is decreased. This ensures users
                do not have to read across the full length of a desktop screen.
            </p>
            <p>A Minimal approach was to be taken. This led me to split sections of pages into different pages such as
                the blog posts. This allows for a more satisfying and less cluttered experience on each separate page.
            </p>
            <p>
                The colour scheme will be very dark grey and white with an accent colour that draws user attention. The
                use of fewer colours adds to the minimalism aspect and makes the one accent colour standout a lot more
                and therefore draw the user’s attention.
