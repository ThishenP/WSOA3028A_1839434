            <h3>The dot com bubble</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
            The dot com bubble was an extremely important moment in the history of the internet and the way in which
            internet companies were run. The dot com bubble refers to a period of time in which a massive amount of
            growth
            was seen in many internet based companies. This growth led to many people seeing any internet company as a
            foolproof investment in which nothing could go wrong. People continued to invest large amounts of money in
            any
            company that fit the mould but there was a lack of research done into these companies. Full business models
            were
            not discussed or developed fully but people invested because of fast growth. The fast growth was mainly due
            to
            many buying into the idea of internet business but was not backed by any real financial forecasts or
            valuations.
        </p>
        <p>In the year 2000 a catastrophe began taking place in which many large internet companies were lost due to the
            fact that most funding came from hype and misinformation. Once the first few companies started to show bad
            signs
            it led to investors getting scared and moving out of the industry in a frenzied fashion. This point in time
            changed the face of internet companies forever as now they are needed to be more professional and be run
            more
            like traditional businesses. This was ultimately a much needed lesson and was important in moving towards a
            more
            steady and beneficial economy overall but as we have seen by the crypto currency bubble, history repeats
            itself.
            These events show us how important financial information of companies is as well as how important education
            and
            regulation of unicorn tech companies is.

            <h3>The impact of web 2.0</h3>
        </header>
        <p>web 2.0 - The introduction of web 2.0 led to substantial changes in the way we interacted with the internet
            and each other. Web 2.0 is defined as an internet in which users could interact with websites and share
            their own experiences and ideas. Before this evolution of the web the internet was considered a one way from
            of communication in which many people around the world had access to a collection of information created by
            a smaller group of people. With the introduction of web 2.0 collaboration between a much larger amount of
            people became possible. This therefore allowed anybody to add the large wealth of knowledge collected and
            accessible through the internet.
        </p>
        <p>A very important example of the benifits of web 2.0 would be Wikipedia and the extremely fast and
            comprehensive collecting of the worlds knowledge. This was such a powerful tool due to the fact that all
            users of the internet were able to interact with the site and therefore all contribute to a singular goal.
            This large amount of co-operation often refered to as crowd sourcing played a massive role in shaping the
            internet and wealth of knowledge at our finger tips that many of us take for granted
        </p>
        <p>
            This collaboration led to massive networks of like minded people across the world in which information and
            entertainment could spread at an extremely rapid rate. Meme culture thrived through this phenomena of easy
            shareabilty. The ability for anyone to add and interact with the internet also leads to a decreased level of
            credibility to what could be read on the internet and this leads a large amount of fake news being spread.
