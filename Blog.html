            <h3>The uses and importance of metadata</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
            Metadata is a very important aspect of what makes the internet accessible to all users. Metadata refers to
            data which holds information about data. This data explains to bots and or browsers what type of data it is
            looking at and how to deal with such data. Metadata is used behind the scenes in order to display a
            user-friendly and accessible experience for all users.
        </p>

        <p>Metadata can be extremely useful in categorisation and organisation of websites. This is extremely beneficial
            for search engines and everyone using them as the hidden metadata of websites may include things like tags
            or author names. This therefore gives the search engine the ability to use this information to direct users
            to the site they were looking for based on a search that may not exactly mirror the website but still
            relates to the metadata of the site. A user could search for an author and the engine will be able to look
            through the metadata of sites and direct users to the site they were looking for.
        </p>
        <p>Metadata is usually stored and managed in a database known as a metadata registry or repository but extra
            information is needed to understand these databases. This information is hidden from users but utilised by
            computers and programmers in order to only display content relevant to the user.

            <h3>The dot com bubble</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
            The dot com bubble was an extremely important moment in the history of the internet and the way in which
            internet companies were run. The dot com bubble refers to a period of time in which a massive amount of
            growth
            was seen in many internet based companies. This growth led to many people seeing any internet company as a
            foolproof investment in which nothing could go wrong. People continued to invest large amounts of money in
            any
            company that fit the mould but there was a lack of research done into these companies. Full business models
            were
            not discussed or developed fully but people invested because of fast growth. The fast growth was mainly due
            to
            many buying into the idea of internet business but was not backed by any real financial forecasts or
            valuations.
        </p>
        <p>In the year 2000 a catastrophe began taking place in which many large internet companies were lost due to the
            fact that most funding came from hype and misinformation. Once the first few companies started to show bad
            signs
            it led to investors getting scared and moving out of the industry in a frenzied fashion. This point in time
            changed the face of internet companies forever as now they are needed to be more professional and be run
            more
            like traditional businesses. This was ultimately a much needed lesson and was important in moving towards a
            more
            steady and beneficial economy overall but as we have seen by the crypto currency bubble, history repeats
            itself.
            These events show us how important financial information of companies is as well as how important education
            and
            regulation of unicorn tech companies is.

            <h3>The impact of web 2.0</h3>
        </header>
        <p>web 2.0 - The introduction of web 2.0 led to substantial changes in the way we interacted with the internet
            and each other. Web 2.0 is defined as an internet in which users could interact with websites and share
            their own experiences and ideas. Before this evolution of the web the internet was considered a one way from
            of communication in which many people around the world had access to a collection of information created by
            a smaller group of people. With the introduction of web 2.0 collaboration between a much larger amount of
            people became possible. This therefore allowed anybody to add the large wealth of knowledge collected and
            accessible through the internet.
        </p>
        <p>A very important example of the benifits of web 2.0 would be Wikipedia and the extremely fast and
            comprehensive collecting of the worlds knowledge. This was such a powerful tool due to the fact that all
            users of the internet were able to interact with the site and therefore all contribute to a singular goal.
            This large amount of co-operation often refered to as crowd sourcing played a massive role in shaping the
            internet and wealth of knowledge at our finger tips that many of us take for granted
        </p>
        <p>
            This collaboration led to massive networks of like minded people across the world in which information and
            entertainment could spread at an extremely rapid rate. Meme culture thrived through this phenomena of easy
            shareabilty. The ability for anyone to add and interact with the internet also leads to a decreased level of
            credibility to what could be read on the internet and this leads a large amount of fake news being spread.

            <h3>The relation of "The Garden of Forking Paths" to the current state of the World Wide Web</h3>
        </header>
        <p>The garden of forking paths delves into the idea of a labyrinth or maze in which the forking of paths does
            not represent space but time. This thought can be applied in the present age and compared to how we interact
            with the internet. The novel referred to in the garden of forking paths could be considered a hypertext
            novel due to the fact that there is no linear way to read it and it does not make chronological sense. You
            could read through the novel in any order with certain parts linking to others. This directly mirrors the
            way in which the internet works right now. When using the internet it is common for people to continuously
            click through interconnect sites and articles in no particular order.
        </p>
        <p>The fact that sites are all linked to one another leads to a web of interconnected paths that do not have a
            chronological order in which to view but rather a mass of knowledge that users can move through freely. The
            idea of paths forking through time and not space applies to the internet in the sense that people all use
            their time in different ways on the internet based on which path or link they choose to follow and
            investigate.
        </p>
        <p>
            The fact that so many ideas from Jorge Luis Borges are evident in todayâ€™s society illustrates that there are
            many core ideas of how humans would like to communicate and share that did not change over time but came to
            fruition only later due to the lack of technology available. This overarching dream of a garden of forking
            paths may have been realised by the creation of a worldwide network that is now completely normal to us.
