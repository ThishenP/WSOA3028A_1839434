            <p>I am a 23 year old professional skateboarder and photographer living in Joburg. I am passionate about my city
                which I feel is the driving force for my photography. The grittiness and harsh conditions inspire me to give
                an accurate portrayal of day to day life as a skater and creative in the city of gold. </p>
    
            <p>I was born in Johannesburg but lived as an orphan for all my life. I never knew my parents and didnâ€™t fit in
                anywhere. I on many occasions got mixed up with wrong people and got into a lot of trouble. My life turned
                around when i started skating and finally met a like minded community that accepted me as one of their own.
                Skating has and always will be a huge part of my life due to the fact that it put me on the right track.
            </p>
            <p>
                Skating led me to finding a passion for photography. This was due to the fact that every day at the skate
                park people would ask me to film or take pictures of them attempting a trick. As I continued to photograph
                and film my friends I became very interested in composition lighting and everything around photography and
                now you will never catch without a camera in my hand.
