                <p>
                    Avery Sosa is a skateboarder and photographer with big hopes and aspirations who grew up in the centre
                    of Johannesburg CBD. The character grew up in a harsh environment coming from a difficult past being an
                    orphan from a young age. He was created as a rebellious character who questions most of what he is told.
                    This way of thinking stems from his upbringing and the fact that he had no guidance. He had to find his
                    own way around the world which led to him developing his own unique sense of reasoning based solely on
                    his own experiences. The way he thought therefore differed from many of his peers and he never really
                    fit in, he was an outsider in most aspects.

                <p>
                    In the skate community the character finally found a place where he felt he belonged, alongside other
                    creatives and misfits of their respective worlds. This feeling of finally fitting in made him form a
                    strong bond with the craft of skating. Skating became his world and was the first thing he could really
                    focus on. Being ambitions and very creative Avery stepped into another medium of expression which was
                    photography. Avery has always been a very visual person interested in photographic composition, movies
                    and cinematography as well as what he witnessed in everyday life. Through skating he found a way to dive
                    into that world through filming skate videos. Eventually he moved onto to urban photography which he is
                    extremely passionate about. This is due to the fact that he grew up in a very urban and dense area and
                    would always find inspiration in the sharp lines and brutalist nature of his environment.

                <p>
                    In the present, the character has succeeded in many of the goals and aspirations he had but he has a
                    remarkably persistent nature and does not have much time to think of the past. When he does reflect, he
                    is always grateful for how far he has come but does miss some aspects. He feels a sense of nostalgia for
                    the times when he first discovered this community that accepted him when nobody else did.
